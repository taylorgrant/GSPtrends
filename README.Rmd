# GSPtrends

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This is an interface to work with Google Trends. It uses the [gtrendsR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gtrendsR/gtrendsR.pdf) package, but extends functionality a bit. Users are allowed to search for up to 13 brands (Google Trends limit is 5), tables and graphs are returned with raw data, share of search data, and change in search (z-scored).  

Functionality is through a Shiny App that comes with the package. Follow directions to use within the app. 

```{r, out.width = "80%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://res.cloudinary.com/dn83gtg0l/image/upload/v1670267567/Screen_Shot_2022-12-05_at_11.10.10_AM.png")

```
